# Predictive-Analytics-in-Customer-Success

This project uses predictive analytics to enhance customer success through speech and text analytics. It integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate customer service tasks and visualizes key customer engagement metrics using Power BI dashboards.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to improve customer success by analyzing customer interactions, identifying pain points, and automating service processes. We use speech and text analytics to process customer feedback and develop insights, which are visualized in interactive Power BI dashboards.

## Key Features

- **Speech and Text Analytics**: Analyze customer feedback and identify key pain points.
- **NLP Classification Model**: A model to classify customer interactions and automate responses.
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Visualize key customer engagement metrics for decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing, model development, and text analytics.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: To build a classification model for customer feedback.
- **Power BI**: To create interactive dashboards for customer engagement.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models.
- **pandas, numpy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib, seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-success-analytics.git
    cd customer-success-analytics
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the preprocessing and model training scripts:

    ```bash
    python preprocess_data.py
    python train_model.py
    ```

4. For Power BI, follow the instructions in the `/dashboards` folder to load the data and create reports.

## Running the Code

Once everything is set up, you can run the model training and dashboard creation scripts. See each script's respective documentation for more detailed instructions.

- **preprocess_data.py**: Handles data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **train_model.py**: Trains the classification model for customer interaction analysis.
- **create_dashboards.py**: Automates the creation of Power BI dashboards (optional).

## Data Sources

The customer interaction data comes from [Your Data Source]. Make sure you have the appropriate credentials and access permissions to pull the data.
