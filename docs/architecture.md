# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the system architecture for the Predictive Analytics for Customer Success project. The architecture integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Power BI, and data processing techniques to analyze customer interactions and visualize key engagement metrics.

## System Components

### 1. **Data Collection Layer**
- Sources: Customer feedback, call transcripts, chat logs.
- Methods: APIs, databases, CSV/JSON file imports.
- Storage: Cloud-based data storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) or local databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

### 2. **Data Processing Layer**
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Text cleaning (removing stopwords, punctuation, special characters).
  - Tokenization and lemmatization.
  - Sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
- **Tools Used:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling.
  - `NLTK`, `spaCy` for text preprocessing.
  - `scikit-learn` for feature extraction and vectorization.

### 3. **Machine Learning & NLP Model**
- **Model Type:** Text classification using NLP.
- **Algorithms Used:**
  - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Transformer-based models.
- **Training Pipeline:**
  - Feature extraction (TF-IDF, word embeddings).
  - Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
  - Performance evaluation (accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall).

### 4. **Data Visualization & Reporting**
- **Power BI Dashboards:**
  - Visual representation of customer sentiment trends.
  - Interactive reports for business decision-making.
- **Integration:**
  - Data extracted from the database.
  - Automated updates for real-time insights.

### 5. **Deployment & Integration**
- **Model Deployment:** Flask or FastAPI for serving predictions via REST APIs.
- **Dashboard Hosting:** Power BI Service or embedded dashboards.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

## Data Flow Diagram
1. **Data Collection** → Extract raw customer interaction data.
2. **Data Processing** → Clean and preprocess text data.
3. **Model Training** → Train and evaluate NLP classification models.
4. **Visualization** → Generate dashboards in Power BI.
5. **Deployment** → Deploy models via APIs for automation.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of real-time customer sentiment analysis.
- Improved model accuracy using deep learning approaches.
- Scalable architecture with cloud-based solutions.
