# Data Preprocessing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the data preprocessing steps used in the Predictive Analytics for Customer Success project. Data preprocessing is essential to ensure that the input data is clean, structured, and ready for analysis and model training.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project comes from various customer interaction sources, including:
- Call transcripts
- Chat logs
- Customer feedback surveys
- Support tickets

## Preprocessing Steps

### 1. Data Loading
- The raw data is loaded from CSV files, databases, or APIs.
- Pandas is used for handling data structures.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are filled using forward-fill and mean imputation techniques.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Duplicate records are removed to prevent biased analysis.
- **Text Normalization**: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, and whitespace trimming are applied to textual data.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Date Features**: Extracting day of the week, month, and year.
- **Sentiment Scores**: Using NLP techniques to classify customer sentiment.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations.

### 4. Data Transformation
- **Scaling and Normalization**: Standardizing numerical variables to improve model performance.
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text data into individual words or phrases for NLP processing.

## Output
- The processed data is saved as `processed_time_series.csv` for further analysis and model training.
- Additional features such as sentiment scores and date-based attributes are included.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (`pandas`, `numpy`)
- Natural Language Processing (`NLTK`, `spaCy`)
- Statistical methods (`scikit-learn`)
