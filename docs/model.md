# Model Development Documentation

## Overview of the Classification Model
The classification model is designed to analyze customer interactions using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It helps in automating customer service by categorizing feedback, detecting sentiment, and identifying key issues.

## Algorithm(s) Used
- **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model for text classification.
- **Random Forest**: Used for improving accuracy by leveraging ensemble learning.
- **Transformer-based Models (e.g., BERT)**: Applied for deep learning-based text understanding.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- **Training Data**: Collected from customer feedback, chat logs, and support tickets.
- **Validation Approach**:
  - Split dataset into 80% training and 20% validation.
  - Used k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for classification performance.
  - ROC-AUC score for overall model effectiveness.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Grid Search & Random Search**: Applied to optimize model hyperparameters.
- **Key Tuned Parameters**:
  - Learning Rate for deep learning models.
  - Number of Trees for Random Forest.
  - Regularization Strength for Logistic Regression.

## Integration into Customer Service Automation
- The trained model is deployed via a REST API using Flask/FastAPI.
- Integrated with chatbot and CRM systems for automated responses.
- Continuous monitoring and retraining pipeline set up for model updates.
